        Instantiate a new activation function provider based on the given function name.

        This factory method initializes the provider using a named activation function
        such as "sigmoid", "relu", or "softmax". The provider will be responsible for
        applying this function and its derivative during forward and backward passes.

        Args:
            activation_function (str): The name of the activation function to use.

            Self: A configured activation function provider instance.

        Apply the activation function to the input tensor.

        This method is typically called during the forward pass of a perceptron or layer,
        transforming the pre-activation value (z) into the activated output (Å·).

        Args:
            input (ITensor): The input tensor to which the activation function will be applied.

        Compute the derivative of the activation function for the given input.

        This method is used during the backward pass to calculate the local gradient
        of the activation function with respect to the input.

        Args:
            input (ITensor): The input tensor (typically the pre-activation value z).
